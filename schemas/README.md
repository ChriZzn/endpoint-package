# Endpoint Schema

This directory contains the generated schema definitions for documents stored in Elasticsearch.

**These files should not be edited directly, nor should new files be added to this directory directly.**

To generate these files take a look at the READMEs in [custom_schemas](../custom_schemas/README.md),
[custom_subsets](../custom_subsets/README.md),
and the actual script's [event_schema_generator](../scripts/event_schema_generator/README.md)
